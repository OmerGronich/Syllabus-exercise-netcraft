                    <h2>Final Project</h2>
                <p>
                    During the course, we will prepare a large "real world" project from A to Z which summarizes
                    everything we learned in the course and will showcase all the skills and abilities we have acquired.
                    <br><br>
                    In the modern high-tech world, the Full-Stack programmer is tested for his performance - for that
                    purpose many employers want to be impressed with previous jobs / projects we have done. The
                    finishing project has great weight for those employers so we want to demonstrate as much as
                    possible. <br><br>
                    The work on the project begins in the last third of the course and you can use the guidance of the
                    lecturers who will be happy to help formulate, implement and present the idea.

                    <h2>Interview Preparation</h2>
                    <p>How to avoid common mistakes in interviews! A job interview is one of the most important,
                        stressful and sometimes strange situations we go through in our professional lives. We will
                        learn how to manage this phase in the best and most pleasant way, focusing on interviews in the
                        Full Stack field so that both you and your prospective employers receive all the information
                        they need. We'll cover myths about common interviews and mistakes, what employers really want to
                        know, and what things really stand up and fall short. We will share from our experience in
                        Netcraft of hundreds of front-end interviews - anecdotes, experiences, successes and failures,
                        test questions and examples to best prepare you for your next job.</p>
